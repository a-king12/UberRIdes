# Exploratory Analysis of Uber Ride Data in NYC

## Project Overview
This project explores Uber ride data in New York City to uncover patterns in rider behavior. The goal was to identify the **most popular month**, **day**, and **hour** for Uber usage in NYC using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

---

## Key Objectives
1. Analyze ride patterns across different time periods.
2. Identify trends in rider demand to determine peak usage times.
3. Provide actionable insights for ride-sharing optimization.

---

## Process

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Processed raw Uber ride data by:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Converting and formatting timestamps.
  - Extracting key time-related features (`month`, `weekday`, `hour`) for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used descriptive statistics to uncover trends.
- Visualized ride frequency:
  - **By Month**: To find the busiest month.
  - **By Day of the Week**: To highlight weekly demand patterns.
  - **By Hour**: To determine peak hours.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Created compelling visuals to communicate insights, using:
  - **Bar charts** for comparisons.
  - **Line plots** for trends over time.

## Key Insights
- **Most Popular Month**: _[June]_  
  _June experienced the highest number of rides, likely due to summer travel and tourism._
  
- **Most Popular Day**: _[IFridays and Saturdays]_  
  _Fridays saw the most rides, suggesting increased demand heading into the weekend._

- **Most Popular Hour**: _[11pm]__  
  _Evening hours are peak times, driven by events, nightlife, and commuting._

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and cleaning.
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn`: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and running the analysis.

---

## Results
This analysis provides valuable insights into Uber ride trends, helping:
1. **Ride-sharing companies** optimize resource allocation during high-demand times.
2. **Riders** better plan their trips based on demand patterns.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a-king12/uberrides.git

---

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate weather data to analyze its impact on Uber demand.
- Explore geographic patterns in ride distribution across NYC boroughs.
- Use machine learning to predict high-demand times.
